## **Weekend Project Instructions**

### **Overview**
This project is focused on consolidating the knowledge acquired this week by creating a joke generator app to give it a unique customisable "features".

### **Objectives**

* Create a GitHub repository for the project.  
* Add all group members as contributors.  
* Create and format a README.md file to describe the project.  
* Add a feature for users to customize the Joke Parameters.  
* After configuring the parameters, users should click a button to generate the joke, and the generated response must be returned to the user's screen inside the same page  
* Add a feature for the AI to evaluate if the generated jokes are funny or not, appropriated or not, offensive or not, and other criteria you might judge important  
* Run the Text Generation WebUI application on your local environment and use it to serve the text generation tasks for your application  


## **Detailed tasks**
* You can pick what kind of parameters you would like to offer for your users  
 For example, you could allow users to pick a topic from a list of options (work, people, animals, food, television, etc), a tone for the joke (witty, sarcastic, silly, dark, goofy, etc), the kind of joke (pun, knock-knock, story, etc), and the "temperature" of it (how much randomness/fun you want to add to the joke)
* Consider how you're going to assemble the prompt for the AI model to abide to these parameters
* After configuring the parameters, users should click a button to generate the joke, and the generated response must be returned to the user's screen inside the same page

Run the Text Generation WebUI application on your local environment and use it to serve the text generation tasks for your application
